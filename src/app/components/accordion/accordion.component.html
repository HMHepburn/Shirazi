    <h1>Accordion</h1>
    <p>
        Accordions are useful for delivering large amounts of content in small spaces.
        They include header titles that indicate what content is contained within.

    <p>
        Accordions hide information from users and should thus not be used for displaying essential information.
        The best place to use an accordion is when a page needs to be shortened to reduce scrolling.
        Often accordions are applied to mobile interfaces when white space is in short supply.
