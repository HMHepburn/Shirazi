<div class="alert-container">
    <h1>Alert</h1>
    <p>
        Alerts provide feedback for user actions. They often communicate a message with a level of severity attached to it.
        <br>
        They grab the user's attention to provide important information.
    </p>
    <h3>Standard Alerts</h3>
    <p>
        Standard alerts are used within the context of the application.
        <br>
        <br>
        They can be found within the content area or within a component.
        <br>
        <br>
        Alerts don't typically follow the colour palette of the application - and are meant to attract the user's eye by looking out of place.

            <p>Used when an action requires attention but might not cause errors.</p>

            <p>Provides info to users. Should not be overused to replace regular content</p>
            <br>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Alert bodies can include tooltips, headers, bodies, or more
        <br>
        Alerts may even be formatted similarly to cards - however they should most often be small and not take over other components.
    </p>

    <h3>App-Level Alerts</h3>
    <p>
        App-level alerts are used in the global context of the application.
        <br>
        They are placed at the very top of all content and navigation.
