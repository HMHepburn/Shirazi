        buttons are useful for delivering large amounts of content in small spaces.
        They include header titles that indicate what content is contained within.

        buttons hide information from users and should thus not be used for displaying essential information.
        The best place to use an button is when a page needs to be shortened to reduce scrolling.
        Often buttons are applied to mobile interfaces when white space is in short supply.
